NOW WORK ON THIS

It's the future already (multi-user trading)

I'm enabling users to connect their own Binance accounts to Verzek auto trader

So store their API keys in my database (encrypted).

My server IP (202.61.203.165) is to perform trades for them.

Each user will whitelist my server’s IP on their Binance account.

That way, my server acts as a secure middleman between Binance and every user.

I’ve already done 90% of what’s needed for multi-user trading; we just need to confirm a few final items so my system is fully ready for real connections between users →  backend → Binance e.t.c

Let’s go through it carefully, one layer at a time 👇


⚙️ 1. Server environment ✅

✅ My Vultr server is live, stable, and always-on.
✅ Python + virtual environment installed.
✅ All requirements installed.
✅ Auto-start (crontab) configured.

→ This means my backend (VerzekAutoTrader) is ready to run 24/7.


🔐 2. Secure backend setup for API handling 🔄

To support multi-user Binance connections, my server needs to handle and protect user API keys.

I already understand this part conceptually.
Here’s what you must ensure inside your backend files:

1. Encrypted storage

Users’ api_key and secret_key must be encrypted before saving to database (e.g., with Fernet from cryptography library).

Example:

from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)
encrypted_secret = cipher.encrypt(secret_key.encode())

Store encrypted_secret in DB, and keep key in a .env file (never in code).



2. Decryption for trading

When placing trades, the bot decrypts the stored secret temporarily inside memory.

No plain text keys should ever be logged or printed.



3. Per-user mapping

Each user in your DB should have:

user_id | binance_api_key | binance_secret_enc | exchange_type | status

This allows to handle multiple exchanges (Binance, Bybit, Kraken, etc.) from one unified API handler.


🌐 3. Binance integration readiness

The server is already connected to the internet with IP 202.61.203.165, which is perfect.
Now, every user must:

Go to their Binance API Management.

Create an API key (name: VerzekAutoTrader).

Whitelist my server IP (202.61.203.165).

Provide their key + secret to your app (which encrypts and sends to the backend).


Once they’ve done that, all trades routed through your backend will be authenticated and accepted by Binance.

✅ Your server’s IP is now the single “trusted gateway” for all Binance traffic.

🧩 4. Internal verification checklist

To confirm everything works end-to-end:

1. Check the database or user table exists
(Contains encrypted API keys linked to each Telegram or app user.)


2. The trade executor (trade_executor.py)
Reads decrypted credentials dynamically and executes per user.


3. The Telegram listener or app backend
Sends trade requests with user_id context.


4. Logs
logs/trades.log or equivalent should capture:

user id

exchange

symbol

action

timestamp
(No API keys!)


If these are all true, the system is fully ready for production-level multi-user Binance trading ✅


🚀 Next step

Review my trade_executor.py and user_manager.py to confirm encryption and multi-user flow, or

Help me set up Bybit and Kraken connectors next (they follow the same IP whitelist logic).

Make sure it everything works for other exchanges Bybit, Phemex, Kraken
