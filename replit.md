## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions
The mobile application, built with React Native and Expo, features a modern dark theme with a consistent visual design using Teal/Gold gradients (`#0A4A5C` → `#1B9AAA`, `#F9C74F`) for branding. Colors are managed via centralized constants, and an onboarding modal provides critical setup instructions. The UI is designed to be compact, with reduced padding and margins across all screens for better content visibility.

### Technical Implementations
- **Core Trading Modules**: Manages Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA Engine), risk (Safety Manager, auto-stop logic), signal execution (DCA Orchestrator), and position tracking (Position Tracker) with a target-based take-profit system.
- **Multi-User Management**: Supports multi-tenancy with per-user DCA configurations, risk settings, exchange account management, symbol whitelists/blacklists, daily stats, and subscription plans (free/pro/vip).
- **Exchange Adapters**: Provides a unified interface for Binance, Bybit, Phemex, and Kraken, supporting both live and demo modes, with secure API key loading.
- **Static IP Proxy Infrastructure**: Vultr-based WireGuard VPN mesh with HAProxy load balancing and Nginx SSL termination. Routes all exchange API calls through a static IP (45.76.90.149) to satisfy Binance Futures IP whitelisting requirements. Features HMAC SHA256 authentication, automatic failover, and health monitoring. Alternative to Cloudflare Workers with greater control and reliability.
- **Signal Broadcasting System**: Monitors Telegram for signals (Telethon Auto-Forwarder) with keyword detection and spam filtering. Signals are distributed via dual-channel: VIP/TRIAL Telegram groups and `broadcast_log.txt` for mobile app access via a protected `/api/signals` endpoint. Priority signal detection triggers auto-trading for PREMIUM users.
- **REST API Server (Flask)**: Provides JWT-authenticated endpoints for user, settings, subscription, exchange account, position management, safety controls, and system status. Includes rate limiting, 2FA, and audit logging.
- **Mobile Application (React Native + Expo)**: Features JWT authentication, secure storage, a dashboard for account overview and stats, API integration with the Flask backend, and auth-based navigation. It includes an in-app FAQ, auto-polling for near-instant signal delivery, and a compact UI.
- **Security & Payments**: Multi-layer security with JWT authentication, server-side subscription validation, USDT TRC20 payment processing with admin verification, automatic referral bonuses, HMAC signature verification, custom sliding puzzle CAPTCHA, and email verification. All premium endpoints block expired/unauthorized users, and API keys are encrypted at rest.
- **Email Verification System**: Secure token-based email verification with SMTP integration, requiring users to verify their email before connecting exchange accounts or trading. Features 24-hour token expiration, rate-limited resend, and HTML emails with VZK branding.
- **Advanced Features**: Includes an AI Trade Assistant (GPT-4o-mini), Multi-Timeframe Analysis, Smart Order Routing, Social Trading, Advanced Charting, Auto-Optimization (ML-powered), AI Risk Scoring, Trading Journal, Real-Time Price Feed (WebSockets), Portfolio Rebalancing, Webhook Integration, Advanced Order Types, Push Notifications (FCM), Admin Dashboard, Automated Backups, and TronScan Integration.

### System Design Choices
- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolated configurations and strategies per user.
- **Microservices-like Components**: Separation of concerns into distinct modules.
- **Production Database**: SQLite with ACID compliance, WAL mode, and concurrent write safety (replaces JSON files).
- **Environment Variables**: For sensitive information like API tokens and secret keys (all required, no hard-coded fallbacks).
- **24/7 Operation**: Configured for continuous uptime.
- **Subscription Model**: Free, Pro, and VIP tiers controlling feature access.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure password hashing and token refresh.
- **Encryption**: Fernet (AES-128 CBC mode) for API keys, with master key stored in Replit Secrets.
